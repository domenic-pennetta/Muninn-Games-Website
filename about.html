                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>Muninn Games was founded in 2018 by two best friends with a shared dream of one day making a videogame. We are a team of two located in the Midwestern United States who both share a passion for making games!</p>

                <h2>Game Developer - Trent</h2>
                <p>Trent used to be an engineer but is now following his dreams to be an independent developer. When he isn’t fixing bugs, he’s out hiking with friends, 3D printing parts for his computer, or replaying <i>Dungeon of the Endless</i> for the 100th time.</p>

                <div class="spacer"></div> <!-- adds space between elements -->

                <h2>Lead Artist - Domenic</h2>
                <p>Domenic loves to draw and is responsible for creating concept art for every one of our projects. He is also a talented pixel artist and animator! When he's not working on game assets, he is creating scientific illustrations, playing <i>Age of Empires III</i>, or publishing a new issue of Astrovitae (a magazine he had published). Wow!</p>

                <div class="spacer"></div> <!-- adds space between elements -->

                <h2>Lead Geologist - Geoff</h2>
                <p>Geoff is our on-site geologist. Why would a game studio need a geologist, you might ask? Well, because they ‘rock’! Okay, you got us... Geoff is actually our pet rock who hitched a ride back home with us from Appalachia. But he sill deserves an honorable mention here!</p>
