                <h1>BASKET HEAD</h1>
                <p>In <i>Basket Head</i>, the player takes control of a new beekeeper in a medieval
                coastal village, donning that ever-friendly basket mask to protect them from
                bees. By day, the player will tend to their bees, collecting honey from their
                hives which they will then sell. However, all is not what it seems. Beneath the
                ancient apiary lies many secrets that are better off left forgotten. Cursed
                knowledge of the Bees of old corrupts the land…</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The Basket Head prototype will consist of a single predetermined apiary map
                    where the player will be able to place flowers and hives freely as they spread
                    eldritch corruption.</p>

                <div class="center-box">

                    <figcaption>The main layout of the apiary. Notice a funny statue? That's Bzzzulhu!</figcaption>
                </div>

                <p>Basket Head is a casual Beekeeping sim. The general gameplay revolves
                    around planting flowers, tending to your hives, raising money by selling honey,
                    and unleashing eldritch terror upon the world, all without raising too much
                    suspicion along the way. The goal of Basket Head is to spread the corruption of
                    the Eldritch god Bzzzulhu using your bees and corrupted flowers.
                    Going forward, we would like to add in more rogue-lite elements, but we cut
                    them for this Game Jam.</p>

                <h2>Art Direction</h2>
                <p>Since <i>Basket Head</i> takes place in the Middle Ages, we decided to reference art
                from that period, especially illuminated manuscripts which were fairly
                common at that time. Various intertwining plants, decorative floral elements,
                and uncanny people felt like the perfect style for the game.</p>
