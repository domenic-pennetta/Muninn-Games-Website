                <h1>SCROUNGED</h1>
                <p><i>Scrounged</i> takes place in an alternate timeline on Earth, 50 years after the rise of an environmental apocalypse. A foreign fungal-like species called "Thanospora" or “Death’s Dust”, rapidly infects populations and consumes all organic matter across the world—permanently altering Earth, destroying civilizations, and killing billions. Only scattered groups of humans survived, all of whom attempt to adapt to their new world by scrounging equipment, terraforming land, looting ruins, and fighting their way through infected creatures and hazardous fungal environments.</p>

                <h2>Combat:</h2>
                <p>During combat, the game will alternate between two phases: the planning phase and the action phase. During the planning phase, the player will be able to see what actions their enemies plan on doing, and are able to give their units orders based on that knowledge. In the action phase, all units, both player and enemy, will start moving and performing actions given during the planning phase.</p>
                
                <p>However this two phase system is not yet set in stone. Another option we may incorporate is to have a two timed turns for both the player and the enemy opponent. During the player’s turn, they will still be able to see what the enemy plans on doing, but now they are timed as they figure out the best strategy for carrying out actions. The player can pause to take time to think—but their units only have so much time to complete the desired actions. Once that time limit is reached, the enemy turn will begin and work similarly to the player’s turn, sending their units out to attack the player.</p>

                <h2>Resources:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Food</b> - Food will be consumed by organic units as the player travels between locations in the overworld. Food could be used to heal organic units in the middle of a level.</li>
                    <li><b>Ammo</b> - Ammo will be consumed by units in combat.
                    <li><b>Fuel</b> - Fuel will be consumed in two different ways. Primarily, the player will have to burn fuel to move the vehicles throughout the overworld. If the player runs out of fuel, they will be stranded and have to deploy an emergency mission to obtain more. These missions will be very difficult, as to motivate the player to watch their fuel closely. Fuel will also be burned up in mechanical units.

                <h2>Units:</h2>
                <p>There will be three major types of units in <i>Scrounged</i>: Human, Machine, and Spore. In many other tactics games like <i>Advance Wars</i>, the unit types play a direct game of rock, paper, scissors (Air support takes out ground forces, anti-air takes out air, and ground takes out anti-air, etc). While those elements will be present in <i>Scrounged</i>, it won’t be as black and white.</p>

                <p>In general, human units will be the most flexible, leaning into tools and clever tactics in order to take on different challenges. Human units will have the range and tools which would help them outmaneuver and take out machine units.</p>

                <p>Machine units will be loud, bulky, and powerful. Units like Tactical One-treaded Nanotank Kill-machine (T.O.N.K.) may not be the most mobile or stealthy in the game, but they will be able to deal with numerous enemies when placed strategically. For example, let’s say T.O.N.K. has a flamethrower that deals large damage in a line. If you position a TONK at the end of a narrow passageway, he could easily take out a whole group of Spore units before they got to him.</p>

                <p>Spore units will be fast and quiet, but will generally lack range in their attacks. Spore units are especially good at overwhelming human units with numbers and their speed, but will often struggle against mechanical units which can brute force their way through them.</p>
