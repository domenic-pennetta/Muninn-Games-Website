                <h1>MERC COMPANY</h1>
                <p><i>Merc Company</i> is a rogue-lite action platformer game. Players will get to explore pseudo-procedurally generated maps filled with a variety of alien races, items, and enemies! As the game progresses, new playable characters known as 'mercs' (mercenaries) will be unlocked. For those who want more than just gameplay, <i>Merc Company</i> will also feature an intricate network of interweaving backstories revolving around each playble character.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
                <p>Choose from a variety of mercs that all have unique traits and abilities! Each merc will begin their journey in the "Scattered Shot", an infamous bar where many mercenaries and criminals reside. Within this bar you can find mission contracts with other characters where you are tasked with completing tough objectives that yield rewards. Missions get exceedingly difficult, so it is important to make good contracts and collect helpful items along the way.</p>
                
                <p>Oh, and don't forget celebrating a completed mission contract with a fresh drink from the bar! Drinks are consumable items found only at the Scattered Shot and they have special effects and stat boosts... So drink up!</p>

                <h2>Pseudo-Procedural Map Generation:</h2>
                <p>We originally wanted our maps to be entirely procedurally generated. During initial tests, we found that procedural generation lead to far too much inconsistency and randomness. Premade linear maps was another option, but we feared linear map design would get stale and repetitive over time and greatly reducing the replayability of the game.</p>
                    
                <p>Instead, we opted for a hybrid process of map generation that took elements of both procedural generation and linear map design. Basically, instead of having one large linear map, we designed several miniature maps that would fit together like a puzzle to form one large area!</p>

                <h2>Meet the Mercs:</h2>
                <p>Each merc will have distinct abilities and unique playstyles. We plan to have a large roster of characters in the future, but right now we are just focusing on completing 6 playable mercs for our updated demo. The first character we decided to work on was Gourmet! Gourmet is an anglerfish-type alien the currently spends his time slashing, seasoning, and devouring anything that stands in his way, all in the name of indulging himself in a quest for the perfect flavor! Check out other characters below:</p>
