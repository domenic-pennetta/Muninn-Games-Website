                <h1>SCRAP SHOT</h1>
                <p>Scrounged takes place in an alternate timeline of Earth, 50 years after the rise of an environmental epidemic of apocalyptic proportions. A foreign fungal-like species called "Thanospora", more commonly known as “Death’s Dust”, rapidly infects populations and consumes all organic matter across the world—permanently altering the Earth, destroying civilizations, and killing billions. Only a few scattered groups of humans survive, all of whom attempt to adapt to their new world by scrounging equipment, terraforming land, looting ruins, and fighting their way through infected creatures and hazardous fungal environments.</p>

                <h2>Combat:</h2>
                <p>During the battle phase, the game will alternate between two phases: the planning phase and the action phase. During the planning phase, the player will be able to see what enemies plan on doing, and are able to give their units orders based on that knowledge. In the action phase, all units, both player and enemy, will start moving and performing actions. 
                
                <p>Another option is to have a player and an enemy turn where the turns are timed. During the player’s turn, they will still be able to see what the enemy plans on doing, but now they are timed to figure out what to do. The player can pause time to think, but their units only have so much time to complete the desired actions. Once that time limit is reached, the enemy turn will begin and work similarly to the player turn. The enemies will move or attack as they projected during the player’s turn.</p>

                <h2>Resources:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Food</b> - Food will be consumed by organic units as the player travels between locations in the overworld. Food could be used to heal organic units in the middle of a level.</li>
                    <li><b>Ammo</b> - Ammo will be consumed by units in combat.
                    <li><b>Fuel</b> - Fuel will be consumed in two different ways. Primarily, the player will have to burn fuel to move the vehicles throughout the overworld. If the player runs out of fuel, they will be stranded and have to deploy an emergency mission to obtain more. These missions will be very difficult, as to motivate the player to watch their fuel closely. Fuel will also be burned up in mechanical units.
                        
                </ul>

                <h2>Units:</h2>
                <p>There will be three major types of units in Scrounged: Human, Machine, and Spore. In many other tactics games like Advance Wars, the unit types play a direct game of rock, paper, scissors (Air support takes out ground forces, anti-air takes out air, and ground takes out anti-air, etc). While those elements will be present in Scrounged, it won’t be as black and white.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>In general, human units will be the most flexible, leaning into tools and clever tactics in order to take on different challenges. Human units will have the range and tools which would help them outmaneuver and take out machine units.</p>
